  - Fix audio toggle (P0) — PB-003 — To Do
  - Visual remaining floats indicator (P1) — PB-005 — To Do
  - Analytics events for session start/stop (P1) — To Do

- Sprint B (2w) — Backend & Persistence (P0 + P2)

## Sprint status (current)
This section summarizes the current sprint work and short notes about progress and next steps.

- Sprint A (Controls & Stability) — In Progress (start: 2025-12-22, review: ongoing)
  - PB-001 Mobile & Desktop Joystick Improvements — In Progress
    - Notes: Multi-touch behavior and hit-target separation are being iterated; Playwright joystick smoke test added as a skeleton (`tests/playwright/joystick.spec.ts`).
    - Next: finish pointer/touch handling, add multi-touch tests, and polish visuals.
  - PB-002 Minimal HUD / Compact UI Mode — To Do
    - Notes: Design notes exist; implementation pending.
  - PB-003 Audio toggle persistence bugfix — To Do
    - Notes: Repro on iOS/Chrome; small fix expected (1 day).
  - PB-005 Visual remaining floats indicator — To Do
    - Notes: UI mock exists; needs HUD integration.

## Definition of Done (per backlog item)
- Code compiles (`npm run check`), unit/CI tests pass (where applicable), and manual QA passes on desktop & mobile.
- PR includes clear description, testing notes, and links to any updated docs or design artifacts.
- Back-end changes include migration scripts where needed and a rollback plan.

## Notes
- Estimates are rough and assume 2-person devs; adjust during sprint planning.
- Prioritize P0 items; keep P2+ items gated behind user-feedback and analytics signals.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Commit these docs to a branch and open a PR to trigger the preview workflow and produce a preview URL.
- Expand any backlog item into a ticket template or Playwright test skeleton.

## Backlog Item — Expanded Example (PB-001)

Title: Mobile & Desktop Joystick Improvements

Description:
- Make joystick responsive across common mobile browsers.
- Separate competitor catch area from joystick when on mobile to avoid accidental input conflicts.
- Improve visual affordance and hit targets for accessibility.

Acceptance criteria:
- Joystick area size is configurable and defaults to 120px for small mobile screens.
- Joystick supports multi-touch and does not capture unrelated gestures (e.g., page scroll).
- No regressions in desktop keyboard/mouse input.

Implementation notes:
- Use pointer events and `touch-action` CSS hints.
- Extract joystick into `client/src/components/ui/Joystick.tsx` if not already separated.
- Add unit/Playwright tests for basic movement and multi-touch behavior.

Test/QA tasks:
- Manual: Test on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and desktop Chrome/Firefox.
- Automated: Playwright skeleton test added in `tests/playwright/joystick.spec.ts` (placeholder).

## Sprint Planning (example)

Sprint goal: Ship joystick and minimal HUD improvements (CURRENT SPRINT — Sprint A)
Sprint length: 2 weeks (typical)
Team: 2 engineers, 1 designer

Planned items for Sprint A (current status):
- PB-001 Joystick improvements (8 points) — In Progress (work ongoing; remaining: ~3-5 points depending on final QA)
- PB-002 Minimal HUD (5 points) — To Do
- PB-003 Audio toggle persistence (2 points) — To Do
- PB-005 Remaining floats indicator (3 points) — To Do

Total planned estimate: 18 points (original plan) — Current remaining: ~10-13 points (PB-001 partially complete)
