# 📦 Documentation Archive

This directory contains deprecated documentation files that are no longer active but preserved for historical reference.

## 📋 About This Archive

These files represent previous directions and approaches for the Mardi Gras Parade project. They have been archived because:

1. **Project refocus** - The project shifted from dual-platform (Web + Unreal) to browser-based only
2. **Consolidation** - Information was merged into simplified guides
3. **Platform changes** - Platform-specific docs (e.g., Replit) are no longer relevant
