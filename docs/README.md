# Project Documentation Index

This folder contains the canonical project artifacts for NDI_MardiGrasParade.
Use this index to quickly find the Game Design Document, Product Backlog, Roadmap, and QA/ticket templates.

Files (canonical):

- `Game_Design.md` — full Game Design Document (mechanics, systems, controls, visuals, audio, acceptance criteria).
- `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` — prioritized backlog, roadmap, sprint candidates, and monetization notes.
- `TICKET_TEMPLATE.md` — ticket/issue template and QA checks.

How to use these docs

- Overview and quick links are kept in this index; each file contains detailed tables and tasks suitable for turning into issues.
- When opening a PR, reference the relevant doc section (GDD, backlog item ID) in the PR description.
- Maintainers: update the backlog file (`PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`) when priorities change; mark completed items with a status column.

Suggested next steps

- Convert high-priority backlog rows into GitHub issues (one per feature/bug). I can generate those automatically if you want.
- Expand Playwright test skeletons and attach them to backlog items for CI validation.
