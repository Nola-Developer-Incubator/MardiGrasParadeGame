# 📋 Deprecated Documentation

This file lists documentation that has been deprecated as part of the project's refocus on browser-based development.

---

## 🔄 Project Direction Change

The Mardi Gras Parade project has shifted focus from a dual-platform approach (Web + Unreal Engine) to a **browser-based simulator** that can be played on desktop and mobile devices through web browsers.

## 📁 Archived Documentation

The following documentation files have been archived or removed as they are no longer relevant to the current project direction:

### Unreal Engine Documentation
These files related to the Unreal Engine conversion that is no longer being pursued:

- **UNREAL_BLUEPRINT_GUIDE.md** - Blueprint customization guide for Unreal Engine
- **QUICK_START_UNREAL.md** - Unreal Engine setup instructions
- **UNREAL_CONVERSION_PLAN.md** - 12-week Unreal conversion roadmap
- **UNREAL_SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Unreal project setup completion guide
- **START_HERE.md** - Entry point for Unreal development
- **RUNNING_BOTH_VERSIONS.md** - Guide for running web and Unreal versions simultaneously

### Redundant Documentation
These files contained information that has been consolidated into the new documentation:

- **README_CREATION_COMPLETE.md** - Consolidated into main README.md
- **README_DUAL_PLATFORM.md** - Consolidated into main README.md
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Information integrated into main guides
- **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md** - Replaced by simplified structure
- **replit.md** - Platform-specific documentation no longer needed

## ✨ Current Documentation Structure

The project now uses a simplified documentation structure:

```
Nola-Developer-Incubator/
├── README.md                      # Main project documentation
└── docs/
    ├── CONTRIBUTING.md           # Contribution guidelines
    ├── DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md      # Technical development guide
    └── DEPRECATED.md             # This file
```

### Primary Entry Points

- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Start here for project overview, quick start, and features
- **[docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - For all contributors (developers, designers, artists)
- **[docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** - For technical developers

## 🎯 Why the Change?

### Reasons for Refocusing

1. **Accessibility** - Browser-based games reach more players without installation
2. **Cross-platform** - Works on any device with a modern browser
3. **Development Speed** - Faster iteration and deployment with web technologies
4. **Maintainability** - Single codebase is easier to maintain
5. **Immediate Playability** - Players can start instantly via URL

### What This Means

- **No installation required** - Just open the URL and play
- **Automatic updates** - Players always have the latest version
- **Mobile support** - Touch controls work on phones and tablets
- **Simpler contribution** - Easier for developers to get started
- **Faster development** - Focus on one technology stack

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

While Unreal Engine development is not currently active, the door remains open for future expansion:

- Native mobile apps (React Native or similar)
- Desktop applications (Electron or Tauri)
- VR experiences
- Console ports

However, the current focus is on delivering the best browser-based experience possible.

---

## 📚 Historical Reference

If you need to reference the old documentation for any reason, it may be available in Git history:

```bash
# View file history
git log --all --full-history -- path/to/file.md

# Checkout old version of a file
git show commit-hash:path/to/file.md
```

Or contact the project maintainers for archived copies.

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you're looking for information that was in deprecated documentation:

1. **Check the new documentation** - It may be consolidated into the current guides
2. **Open an issue** - Ask if the information is available elsewhere
3. **Search Git history** - The information may still exist in older commits
4. **Ask the community** - Someone may remember or have saved the info
