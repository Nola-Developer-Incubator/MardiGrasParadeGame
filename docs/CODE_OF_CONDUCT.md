Date: 2025-12-14

We value a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct.

## Our Standards
- Be respectful and courteous. Critique code, not people.
- Be inclusive. Encourage diverse contributors and avoid exclusionary language.
- Be patient. Open-source contribution can be challenging; offer guidance.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, hate speech, or threats of violence.
- Personal attacks, doxxing, or sharing private information.
- Discriminatory or sexual content.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness a violation, file an issue with the `conduct` label and @mention a maintainer.

## Enforcement
Maintainers will review reports and take action proportionate to the violation, up to removing offending content or banning a user from the repo.
