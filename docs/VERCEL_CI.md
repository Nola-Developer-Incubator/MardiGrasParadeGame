# CI/CD Setup Guide (legacy)

(Archived) This CI/CD guide for the previous hosting provider has been deprecated.

The project no longer recommends the previous hosting provider for automatic deployments. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` and the top-level `README.md` for current deployment instructions (GitHub Pages is the recommended frontend hosting option).

If you need the original CI/CD guide, it has been archived at `archive/legacy-hosting/VERCEL_CI.md`.
