## Project status (consolidation)

- Project Lead: Brian C Lundin
- Canonical repository path: `C:\Coding_Projects\MardiGrasParadeSim`
- Recent consolidation: files merged from a secondary copy (Unreal project) into this canonical repo. Modified files were backed up next to the originals as `*.bak.<timestamp>` and a zip archive was created under `archive/`.
- Backups: see `archive/mardi-consolidate-backup-<timestamp>.zip` and `*.bak.<timestamp>` files across the tree.

## Public playtest (quick)

This repo supports an ephemeral public playtest URL using Cloudflare `cloudflared` or `localtunnel` (fallback).

1. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Preferred (persistent Cloudflare hostname)

- Hostname: https://mardigrasparadesim2026.busaradigitalstrategy.com
- Start the persistent tunnel on your host (requires `cloudflared login` once):

```powershell
# Use the bundled cloudflared or your installed cloudflared
# Ensure credentials file exists: C:\Users\BLund\.cloudflared\<tunnel-credentials>.json
# Start the persistent tunnel (runs until stopped):
.\scripts\cloudflared.exe --config scripts\cloudflared-config.yml tunnel run MardiGrasParadeSim2026
```

3. Fallback (ephemeral, quick share)

```powershell
# Ensure dev server running on localhost:5000
npx localtunnel --port 5000 --print-url
# Example ephemeral URL: https://hot-lizard-90.loca.lt
```

4. Confirm URL (helper writes `docs/last-public-url.txt` and `docs/launch.html`):

```powershell
Get-Content .\docs\last-public-url.txt
Start-Process .\docs\launch.html
```

Note: The public URLs are intended for playtesting only. Do not expose secrets, admin paths, or internal APIs while the tunnel is active.


## Why do Replit files exist?

- The project historically included a Replit configuration (`.replit` and related files) to support running an embedded instance on Replit for demos or quick previews.
- We are consolidating to a single canonical location and keeping Replit files out of the active tree to avoid confusion.
- A helper was added to archive Replit-related files safely (it moves them into `archive/replit-removed-<timestamp>/`). See `scripts/archive-replit-files.ps1`.

If you want to restore Replit support, the archived files can be restored from that folder or the repository backup.

## Cleanup & housekeeping

- A new script `scripts/archive-replit-files.ps1` moves Replit config files out of the repo into `archive/replit-removed-<timestamp>/` for review. It is conservative and safe.
- After review, please push the consolidation branch and open a PR. The PR body should explain the consolidation and list the backup locations.
