## 🌐 Live Demo

**Note:** This repository has been migrated away from the previous hosting provider; frontend deploys are now recommended via GitHub Pages. The previous hosting configuration has been archived in `archive/legacy-hosting/` and top-level backups for reference.

A small set of legacy Vercel configuration and deployment files have also been archived to `archive/vercel-archive/` for historical reference; they are no longer used for current deployments.

If you still have a working public URL from the previous hosting, you can use it for playtesting, but new deploys should use GitHub Pages (instructions below).

### Public Playtest URL (where to put your live link)

- When the site is published via GitHub Pages the canonical public URL will be:
-
-  https://Nola-Developer-Incubator.github.io/MardiGrasParadeGame/

- Example placeholder for this repository (published under the original org):

  https://Nola-Developer-Incubator.github.io/MardiGrasParadeGame/

- To find your exact public URL after publishing:
  1. Open your repository on GitHub.
  2. Go to Settings → Pages (or look at the GitHub Pages section on the main repo page) — it will show the published URL.
  3. If using the `deploy-gh-pages` workflow, check the Actions run logs — the job will indicate the final published URL.

> NOTE: Replace the placeholder above with your org/username and repository name when sharing a public playtest link.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages (recommended)

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site and publishes `dist/public` to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch). The workflow is located at `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`.

To deploy manually via Actions:
1. Push to `main` (the workflow will build and publish automatically), or use the `workflow_dispatch` trigger in the Actions UI to run it on demand.
2. Ensure `npm run build` completes successfully and `dist/public/index.html` is created.

The site will be available at `https://Nola-Developer-Incubator.github.io/MardiGrasParadeGame/` when published.

Local publish (developer):

1. Build the site and publish to the `gh-pages` branch using the included npm script (this uses the `gh-pages` package to push a commit to the `gh-pages` branch):

```powershell
# Build and publish to gh-pages branch (local)
npm run deploy:gh-pages:local
```

2. If you only want to build and inspect the output without publishing, run:

```powershell
# Build only (creates dist/public)
node ./scripts/build-gh-pages.js
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

Get the simulator running in under 2 minutes (developer):

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Nola-Developer-Incubator/MardiGrasParadeGame.git
cd MardiGrasParadeGame

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Start development server (dev):
npm run dev

# Open locally → http://localhost:5000
```

### Run the built production server (serves `dist/public` on port 5000)

```powershell
# Build client + bundle server
npm run build

# Start the production server (serves both API and front-end)
npm start

# Open in browser: http://localhost:5000
```

### Windows PowerShell notes

If you get errors like "`npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system`", run this in PowerShell (temporary for the session):

```powershell
# Allow scripts for this session (safe, temporary):
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force

# If npm.ps1 wrapper still blocks, run via cmd fallback:
cmd /c "npm ci"
```

If `npx` or `npm exec` is blocked by the PS wrapper, use the `cmd /c` fallback shown above.

---

## 🔗 Public Playtest

- Developers: run the local dev server with `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:5000`.
- If the dev server does not appear to start, try running the built server (production) with `npm run build` and `npm start` — this will serve the already-built `dist/public` on port 5000.
- For a public instance, deploy using the GitHub Pages workflow or another hosting provider. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for more options.

## 🌐 Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)

This application is production-ready for GitHub Pages deployment. A workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` builds the site and publishes `dist/public` to the `gh-pages` branch.

To deploy manually via Actions:
1. Push to `main` (the workflow will build and publish automatically), or use the `workflow_dispatch` trigger in the Actions UI to run it on demand.
2. Ensure `npm run build` completes successfully and `dist/public/index.html` is created.

The site will be available at `https://Nola-Developer-Incubator.github.io/MardiGrasParadeGame/` when published.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting & Public Playtest

If the public playtest URL returns an error (503 or similar):

- Confirm the server is running locally: `npm run dev` (serves on http://localhost:5000)
- Check the health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5000/health` should return `{ status: 'ok' }`.

  PowerShell (Windows):

  ```powershell
  # check health
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://localhost:5000/health' -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object StatusCode, Content
  ```

  curl (macOS / Linux / Windows with curl):

  ```bash
  curl -v http://localhost:5000/health
  ```

- For a publicly accessible instance, deploy using the GitHub Pages workflow or another hosting provider.

## 🛡️ Server & Deployment Updates (2025-12-18)

- Graceful shutdown implemented: server now tracks open sockets and destroys lingering connections on shutdown. This improves reliability when restarting under process managers (pm2) or tunnels (cloudflared).
- Use `startServer()` export from `server/index.ts` for programmatic start/shutdown in tests/CI
