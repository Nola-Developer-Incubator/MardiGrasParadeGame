# Archived Artifacts

This page documents why artifacts were archived and where the compressed zip lives in the repository.

Archive location
- Folder (archived then compressed): `archive/generated-2025-12-09/` (now replaced with zip)
- Zip file in repo: `archive/generated-2025-12-09.zip`

Reason for archiving
- Generated/test artifacts are noisy and can bloat the git history; archiving preserves them while keeping the code tree tidy.

Restoration
- See `archive/README.md` for exact steps to restore files from the zip.
