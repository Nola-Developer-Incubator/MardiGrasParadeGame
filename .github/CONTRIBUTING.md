# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A few guidelines to make contribution smooth:

- Fork the repo and create a branch named `chore/your-change` or `feature/your-feature`.
- Run `npm ci` and `npm run check` before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs small and focused; include tests when applicable.
- Use the issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.
- For monetization changes, document product/price changes in `docs/MONETIZATION.md`.
